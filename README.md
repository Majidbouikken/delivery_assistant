# Delivery Assistant
Delivery Assistant is a school project, as part of the TDM module
## Functionalities as stated in the project support file
- Authentication : Login only with a username and a password (I kinda missed that here by making it do the thing with an email instead of a username)
- Display of orders to be delivered : list of orders (name, email, phone number and address of orderer, and the total price of the delivery)
- Display of product list on each order : name of product, unit price and quantity
- Order validation : done by scanning the codebar on the order package, used the https://github.com/journeyapps/zxing-android-embedded implementation
- Dashboard : Display total count of remaining orders, total count of delivered orders, and number of orders delayed by 2 days
